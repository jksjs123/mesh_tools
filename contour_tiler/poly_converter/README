README for File converters

Currently, I support conversions from the following file formats to the RAW format:
a) POLY
b) IPOLY
c) GLX
d) FAT
e) STL
f) RAW: It removes all the unreferenced vertices in the current RAW file.
g) IV
h) WRL
i) VRML

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Usage is as follows:

       <number> can be any of the following:
       0: for fixing a RAW file
       1: for POLY to RAW
       2: for IPOLY to RAW
       3: for GLX to RAW
       4: for FAT to RAW
       5: for STL to RAW
       6: for VRML to RAW
       7: for IV to RAW
       8: for WRL to RAW
       9: for RAW to STL

Input and Output file names are the second and third arguments.

Optional parameter <-h> prints out this usage message.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
eg: -n 8 -in "dunno.wrl" -out "test.raw"

Misc: In case you come across any other file format routine, please append the code to this directory and make changes to this readme file :-)

NOTE: This directory also contains the following files:
a) raw.cpp 	:- It can add the 68bytes header information to a RAWIV file.
b) main.cpp	:- it can read all the RAW files in a directory and merge them into a single RAW file.
