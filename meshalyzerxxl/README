Triangulated surface intersection detection is a well-studied problem with solutions offered by RAPID and VCollide (~/lib/).

Rapid detects intersections of pairs of objects.
Vcollide uses Rapid to detect intersections between N objects.

Suspect neither Rapid nor Vcollied are out-of-core compatible. Not sure if either are 64-bit compatible.

For small data sets where entire collection of objects fit in RAM, use Vcollide.
For medium data sets where pairs of obejcts fit in memory, use Rapid and write own Vcollide.
For large data sets where single objects do not fit in memory, write own Rapid and Vcollide by replicating boundingbox tree.
