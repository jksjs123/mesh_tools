NAME
       reconstruct2contourtiler - generate contour_tiler input files from contours

SYNOPSIS
       reconstruct2contourtiler [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Converts reconstruct contour format to contour_tiler input format.
       All files in input directory are assumed to be
       of the form filename_prefix.section#.
       min_section to max_section is the section range to be converted.
       Section_thickness should be in same scale as x,y contour points.
       x,y and z coordinates of sampled splines will be multipled by scale in output.
       CAPPING_FLAG=1 to attempt end capping.CAPPING_FLAG=0 to leave ends open.
       DEVIATION_THRESHOLD is the maximum allowed deviation of the spline from raw
       contour points in scaled units. Set
       DEVIATION_THRESHOLD to 0 to disable thresholding.

EXAMPLES
       reconstruct2contourtiler -i ./contours -f myContours -n 10 -x 100 -t .07 -s 1000 -o ./contour_tiler_output -d 2
              Read contours from directory './contours' and write contour_tiler output
              files to directory 'contour_tiler_output'. The input contour files have the
              name scheme 'myContours.#' where # is the section number which varies from
              10 to 100. The distance between contours in the direction of sectioning
              is .070 microns. The contour_tiler output data will be in nanometers as
              dictated by the 1000 scaling. Capping directives will be included in the
              output data. The interpolated contours will not deviate from the input contours
              by more than 2 (nanometers since scaling is 1000).

OPTIONS
       --no_capping
              Do not include directives in the output data to cap the meshes,
              thus creating open surface meshes.
              Default is to cap the meshes at the minimum and maximum sections
              thereby creating closed surface meshes.

       --print_detailed_info
              Print raw contour points, control points, s parameter
              values, etc as .log files in output directory.
              Default is to do nothing.

       --return_raw_contour_points
              Return input contour points unadulterated.
              Default is to fit splines to contour points and resample.

       --return_interpolated_raw_points
              Return input contour points linearly interpolated
              to satisfy minimum and maximum sample interval constraints.
              Default is to fit splines to contour points and resample.

       -n NUM, --min_section=NUM
              The starting section number in the section range.
              Default is '60'.

       -x NUM, --max_section=NUM
              The ending section number in the section range.
              Default is '160'.

       -t NUM, --section_thickness=NUM
              Thickness of the sections. Each section
              is assumed to be of identical thickness.
              Default is '0.05'.

       -S NUM, --additional_points_factor=NUM
              The number of sample points in contour will be
              determined by the ratio of contour length and maximum sample interval plus
              plus a fraction NUM of the samples described by the ratio of contour length
              and minimum sample interval. 0<=NUM<=1.
              Default is '0.5'.

       -X NUM, --max_sample_interval=NUM
              The linear distance between sampled contour points
              will be less than NUM.
              Default is '0.05'.

       -Y NUM, --min_sample_interval=NUM
              The linear distance between sampled contour points
              will be greater than NUM.
              Default is '0.01'.

       -s NUM, --output_scale=NUM
              The output data will be scaled by NUM.
              Default is '1' which means
              output data has same scale as input data.

       -d NUM, --deviation_threshold=NUM
              The input contours are filtered before output.
              The deviation of the input and output contours
              is constrained to be less than NUM where units
              are input units scaled by --scale value.
              Default is '0'.

              no threshold is enforced.

       -a NUM, --curvature_gain=NUM

       -b NUM, --curvature_exponent=NUM

       -c NUM, --proximity_gain=NUM

       -e NUM, --proximity_exponent=NUM
              A sample point contributes to energy in a manner
              proportional to distance between samples to the NUM power.
              Default is '1'.

       -T NUM, --high_temp=NUM
              Starting high temperature of simulated annealing.
              Default is '100'.

       -i DIRECTORY, --input_data_dir=DIRECTORY
              Directory containing input contours.
              Default is current directory.

       -o DIRECTORY, --output_data_dir=DIRECTORY

              Default is current directory.

       -O STRING, --output_script=STRING
              A bash script named STRING will be written 
              to automate contour_tiling process.

       -f STRING, --input_filename_prefix=STRING
              The input contours will be read from
              'input_directory/STRING.min_section' to

              Default is 'Volumejosef'.

       -I STRING, --ignore_contour=STRING
              Contours with name STRING will not be processed
              and no output data will be written for these contours.
