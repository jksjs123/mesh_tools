For some reason this program delivers one less than the requested number of positions in the input sequence
at least as visualized in dreamm. In other words, if the input is *_0.mesh, *_1.mesh, ..., *_5.mesh
then dreamm will display a mesh for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 states in sequence.

This is especially problematic when all you want is a simple before and after. Must use at least three states in sequence.

Actually, it might have been that the sequence numbers in dreamm are incremented by one compared to input mesh sequence numbers.

One bit of confusion may be that meshmorph sequence numbering starts at 0, i.e. input meshes, with 1
representing the meshes after one group of vertex moves. However, dreamm does not have a 0 sequence
position; the sequence starts at 1.
