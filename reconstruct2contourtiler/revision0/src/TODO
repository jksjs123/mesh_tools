## LATER

contour_tiler goes into infinite loop tiling object
with two contours, two contours, one contour with 3 points, one contour, one contour
one five sections. Object s095.

Confirm value of Epsilon

Currently using binary exponents for radius of curvature.
Consider using octal or higher to reduce range of exponents.

Confirm proper handling of transform.
Example: d001 contour on section 92 with '-3' y transform.

report identity of min and max for all statistics.

report median.

Use same histogram bins for sample intervals before and after.

consider using my own namespace.

Option to subdivide long intervals.

resolve all issues with nonintuituve aspects to erroneously
appended data to output contour files and detailed info files.

In Contour::fitAndSampleSplines copy and return vectors to 
Object::fitAndSampleSplines so output data to files is written
only if deviations are acceptable and not duplicated.

Consider starting points at uniform linear distance interval
rather than uniform path distance interval.
// IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE:
//   path length does not vary linearly with s parameter
//   due to nonuniform spacing of control points.

Consider allowing samples to cross one another. 
Likely require lists rather than vectors.

Check with valgrind.
