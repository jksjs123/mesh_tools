Meshfuse creates degenerate faces for CA3 synapse.
Also creates flipped faces and interesecting faces.


1) instead of using squared 3D distance between free vertices as the
metric for determining which vertices to merge, consider using
max(abs(delta x),abs(delta y),abs(delta z))

2) rather than compute the distance between all free vertices in
an N^2 manner, map vertices onto random vector using dot product
and compute distance between neighbors on random vector

3) instead of 2, create connectivity graphs of free edges and
compute distances between vertices within a connected group.
Note that two nonconnected groups that lie close together should
be merged into a larger group.
