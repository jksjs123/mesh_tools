Accomplished
-------------

Added --disable_messages condition to the printing
of intersected faces.

In Intersecting_Faces::updateNewIntersections was detecting face intersections
but was not recording them. So added bool argument to Intersecting_Faces::detectNewFaceInts
to optionally record face intersections.

Had to modify Refractory::vertexIsMoveCandidate so that if vertex is nonnice
then it does not have to have a closest point to be a move candidate.
Something is wrong with detecting closest point for nonnice vertices.
It will be important that closest point is initialized to vertex's current position.

Something is weird with nonnice and intersecting faces code.
1) The largest reduction in nonnice vertices and int. faces occurs on the first group.
    Subsequent groups show diminished progress in removing nonnice vertices.
2) The # of nonnice verts and especially int. faces is different from last group
    of one execution of meshmorph to first group of subsequent execution of meshmorph
    using the output of the first execution as input to the second execution.


Meshmorph does not like coincident surfaces.

Progress meters are inaccurate for CA3 synapse.

Add option to set undetermined vertices to nonnice. Currently, they are set to nice.

Add option to turnoff closestFaceCheck

high separation weight (0.8) crushes thin processes

remove CLOSEST_POINT_COSINE and CLOSEST_POINT_SINE keep CLOSEST_POINT_ANGLE
Why is CLOSEST_POINT_ANGLE reported incorrectly in command....

explicitely clear files that are being appended to.

replace my vector3 with Wm4::Vector3.

Rigorously tune MIN_SEARCH_CONE_RADIUS, by parameter sweep and recording elapsed time for
1E6 ecw measurements.

Improve void Log::writeSepDistances (int const & group)
Needs acceleration and progress reports and improved coding style.
  Each Octree visitor allocates and deallocates 10 doubles.
  This may be the cause of the slowdown.
  Need re-initialize member function for visitor,
  so instantiate single visitor and reuse many times with new search region.
  bool Container::findClosestPtToBarycenter (vector3 const & pt,Face * const f,
  and elsewhere.

Improve formatting in Log::statusFileInit (void).

consider rebuilding octree after each group
since my octree update scheme does not rebalance
should only result in slowdown, not inaccuracy.
gathering octree stats could inform whether this is necessary

fix gain_scheduling

#######################
add detailed comments from source code to doxygen.

Here are a few other general comments, but I doubt that anything simple
can or should be done, either because the fix would be complex, or
because the potential problems are minor, or are mitigated by other
factors.

  - there are some fairly long functions; this is mainly a problem if
    the function has complex control flow, if the code is not
    particularly clean, or if you are developing in a group with other
    people.  Since none of these seem to be the case here, there's
    little point, I think.  The code looks clean enough and
    straightforward enough that a handful of longer functions are not
    really a problem.

  - there are some fairly terse variable names; again, not so much of a
    problem if the functions are short, the control flow clear, and the
    developers few, as in this case.  but if you expect to turn it over
    to someone for maintenance, or if you expected to develop with a
    group of people, you'd want to make sure the variable names were a
    little more verbose, probably.

  - You've got the start of a beautiful man page.  You might make it a
    full man page by modifying the mcell man page I've attached.


Add following to meshmorph.
  << "  Running on azzuri at Wed Sep 24 12:11:51 2008\n\n"

Store octree max instead of width in controls.

protect from buffer overruns

record octree statistics to file, e.g. histogram of cell sizes,
histogram of faces per box, or min,max,median instead

fix doxygen documentation for octree files

-----------
separation springs (moved and region)
stretch springs (adjacent to moved)
angle springs (all edges of adjacent faces to moved)

// NOTE the niceness of barycenters should be calculated.
// For now, I assume no nonnice vertices or barycenters.
// container.cc :1310

consider making checkClosestFace period a global constant

replace simple if-else with ternary conditional '?'

3) use a single map to hold all constants (int, double, string)
   map is string->instance of TypedValue
   Note the singleton class will have two fields
     1) string
     2) union , which makes efficient use of memory to access same memory, interpreted in different ways
   use enum to code different data types

Consider not updating vertex and face normal,
and position in tree after every move. Instead
set face to 'dirty' and recompute only if needed.
In State::assignNewVertexCoords
    updateAdjacentFacesInTree(v);
    updateAdjFaceBoundingBoxes(v);
  v->updateAdjacentFaceNormals();
Ideas for marking as dirty
1) in face set normal vector to 0,0,0
2) in vector set normal vector to 0,0,0
3) best of all, use bool in face and vertex classes

Consider switching from map (virtual displacement -> vertex)
to array of bins with linked lists of vd-vertex pairs hanging off.
Use next and previous are pointers to pointer
To remove item in list,
*p=n;
if (n) n->p=p;

Seems that less than one vertex on average changes its closest face per vertex move.
What is the identity of this vertex?

use flag instead of hashset or set or vector with sort and unique

Perform code coverage analysis:
  Include -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage in compile flags
  Run gcov on output.

In Refractory::determineTryAgainOrMoveOn , decreasing move size is NOT always the
  best idea for each of the refraction violations. Sometimes taking a bigger step
  would be better. Delineate these rules.

In State::recordVertAdjFaceEdgeAngles // NOTE THIS ALGORITHM LIKELY TO CHECK EDGES TWICE.

Consider using for_each STL pg 161 meyers book.

Ideas from Jed for improving speed of meshmorph (Oct2007)
----------------------------------------------
1. use closest vertex as closest point
	(closest vertex and closest point will converge as edge length -> 0)
2. fully morph small regions

Improving speed of classifying niceness of vertices
--------------------------------------------------
After picking ray for tracing
1. project faces onto plane orthogonal to ray
2. Use dot product rule to determine edge hit
	i.e. if dot product of vector from face vertex to ray
	and vector from vertex to other vertex is zero,
	then ray hit edge
3. Detect planes coplanar with ray
4. if edge collision, then jog ray, tracing during jog

Pre-sorting mesh object vertices and faces before running meshmoprh
The goal is to improve speed of creating edges, neighborhoods, findsing closest point, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Want path along edges that
1. touches every vertex exactly once
2. maximizes sequential pair-wise overlap
	so as to minimize cache misses to ultimately minimize run time.

simple idea 1 : sort by x then y then z

**************************************************************************
1. improve speed
2. note that simulated annealing was not attempted because it would be too slow
3. mesh surfaces near world bound are still being tweaked during morphing
	especially for large exposed surfaces such as d000
4. Assess validity of assumptions in README for input mesh files.
	Alternatively, leave it to user to check assumptions using meshalyzer.
5. small processes are shrunk to infinitely thin fingers for large
	ECS widths. Need to enforce a minimum process diameter.

THOUGHTS
---------

Typical shape of neuropil is cylinder.
Shrinking diameter of meshed cylinder without changing its length
requires a change in aspect rati of faces.
This potentially has implications for forces on faces as
function of aspect ratio.
