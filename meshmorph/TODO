Suppose I have a reconstruction whose tunnels (and sheets) have
some distribution of ECWs. Also suppose that I want to freeze
the sheets and expand the tunnel volume to increase the EVF of the
reconstruction. Consider the case where to shift the median of the tunnel
ecw distribution the entire distribution of ecws must increase (like a
translation of the distribution up the width axis). It therefore seems
reasonable in meshmorph to keep

target_ecw_high > current_ecw_mean + n * current_ecw_stddev

(n = 2 or three)

where target_ecw_high is the target ecw of the tunnel vertices. The
reason is that the fraction of the tunnel ecw distribution larger thatn
the target ecw will not increase (either not moving or decreasing!).

The alternative way of increasing the volume of the tunnels by shifting
the median ecw of tunnels is by a sharpening of the distribution towards
the current distribution max value. The increase of median via this
process has an upperbound equal to the max ecw in teh distribution.

Additionally, must continue updating closest points that are
on the high end of the ecw distribution. For example,
if target_ecw_high=160
then perhaps --update_region_size=160
and --search_radius=160

Redefine command line options so an organization by topic also
is organized by some natural progression
of option number (-0,-1,-2,...)
or option character (-a,-b,-c,...,-A,-B,-C,...).

Would be cool if diagnostic print states could include
Class_name::function_name automatically.

Explicitely report for each measurement of mesh
whether mesh state conforms to high-quality expectations.
E.g. # orphan vertices: none/
            becomes
     (good) # orphan vertices: none/
      (bad) mesh is closed: no
Define a map from each possible meshalyzer output to conformity label.

High-aspect ratio faces are a problem.
Specifically, finding closest points to barycenters of tiles.
The closest point on adjacent faces may not be within
the cone of search but are less than SMALL_ECW_THRESHOLD.
Consequently, the situation arises where two faces are coplanar
and the barycenter of a tile and its closest point are coplanar.

Had trouble finding algorithm to work, so I made --ecw_sampling_length=1000
so no tiles would be checked. ECW only measured at vertices.

Does intersecting-face detection depend on value of search cone angle?
Or new closest point policy (i.e. no closest point => zero sep force)?

In timeline.log, simulation time steadily-increases for each subsequent
group of vertex moves.

Possible systematic, preferential crushing of processes according to radius
or smallest cross-sectional dimension. So glia, with high proportion of volume
confined to small processes, is crushed the most. Report change in surface area.

Add option to assume vertices are nice and NOT check niceness
Note that faces that intersect at a point, i.e. edges intersect
may fail assertion in Intersecting_Faces::getCountOfIntFaces
that demands that if face A intersects face B, then Face B intersects
Face A. Came across this with raw output from contour_tiles.


Accomplished
-------------

Disabled checkClosestFace in meshmorph.cc.

#Returned ecw output in log.cc to just 'ecw',
#not 'ecw ptx pty ptz closestx closesty closestz'.
Just reenabled detailed output.

Conditioned last writeSepDistances after morphing complete on cs.get_write_every_group()==false.

From Gain_Schedule class removed ref_gain and period. Now gain gain scheduling works
and changes max_gain.

Added user-modifiable coefficient to step size in max_gain.

Changed default values for edge_stretch_gain and aspect_ratio_gain

Added logic in vertex ecw force calculcation to use target ecw low and high and threshold.

// High priority
#######################

Configure parser to exit if unrecognized command line option.

Add unit test to verify fundamentally, e.g. cppunit or boost libraries.

Likely a mismatch between search region (300) and update region (130?)
explains why checkClosestFace had to be disabled.

Just thought of case not handled by 
bool Container::findClosestPtToVertexAmongFaces (Vertex const * const v,
What of 7 calculated points on face are all outside of search cone,
but the interior of face is within search cone. In other words, the closest
face to vertex within vertex's search cone is on face, but not one of
7 points calculated by Container::findClosestPtToVertexAmongFaces.

Investigate why some vertices have no closest point. Visualization in
DReAMM reveals no obvious cause.

Have print period default be fixed fraction of group size

I should remove EDGE_LENGTH_WEIGHT since I have no intention of changin it.
Using EDGE_LENGTH_GAIN is sufficient.

add warning message if vertices listed in vertex move schedule are not found in input data

enable closest face check

meshmorph is printing get_max_touches which should
be subject to --disable_messages

remove second argument from detectNewFaceInts
and use findAndRecordNewFaceInt

Any '.mesh' in filenames in input directory will be opened.
Add check to not open binary files.
From Jed
"A quick and stupid heuristic method would be to read in the first, say,
100 bytes and check if 'isprint' returns true for all of the characters
read.  (See the man page for isprint for details.)  There are many
variants on this.  Essentially, the file is binary if it contains
non-text data.  Try 'xxd -g1 filename | less' to see the contents of the
file; that will give you some idea whether such a strategy will be
effective.  For instance, it will break on a binary file which starts
with 100 bytes of ASCII data, but will probably succeed on a file
containing just IEEE754 floating point values.  This should, generally,
work for the DREAMM files produced by MCell, since they do not usuallly
include text and binary in the same file, but is NOT a reliable strategy
for DX files in general, which can freely intermix text and binary."

Continue debugging morph of CA3 synapse using version 151.

Meshmorph does not like coincident surfaces.

Progress meters are inaccurate for CA3 synapse.

Add option to set undetermined vertices to nonnice. Currently, they are set to nice.

Add option to turnoff closestFaceCheck

high separation weight (0.8) crushes thin processes

remove CLOSEST_POINT_COSINE and CLOSEST_POINT_SINE keep CLOSEST_POINT_ANGLE
Why is CLOSEST_POINT_ANGLE reported incorrectly in command....

explicitely clear files that are being appended to.

replace my vector3 with Wm4::Vector3.

Rigorously tune MIN_SEARCH_CONE_RADIUS, by parameter sweep and recording elapsed time for
1E6 ecw measurements.

Improve void Log::writeSepDistances (int const & group)
Needs acceleration and progress reports and improved coding style.
  Each Octree visitor allocates and deallocates 10 doubles.
  This may be the cause of the slowdown.
  Need re-initialize member function for visitor,
  so instantiate single visitor and reuse many times with new search region.
  bool Container::findClosestPtToBarycenter (vector3 const & pt,Face * const f,
  and elsewhere.

Improve formatting in Log::statusFileInit (void).

consider rebuilding octree after each group
since my octree update scheme does not rebalance
should only result in slowdown, not inaccuracy.
gathering octree stats could inform whether this is necessary

fix gain_scheduling

// Low priority
#######################
add detailed comments from source code to doxygen.

Here are a few other general comments, but I doubt that anything simple
can or should be done, either because the fix would be complex, or
because the potential problems are minor, or are mitigated by other
factors.

  - there are some fairly long functions; this is mainly a problem if
    the function has complex control flow, if the code is not
    particularly clean, or if you are developing in a group with other
    people.  Since none of these seem to be the case here, there's
    little point, I think.  The code looks clean enough and
    straightforward enough that a handful of longer functions are not
    really a problem.

  - there are some fairly terse variable names; again, not so much of a
    problem if the functions are short, the control flow clear, and the
    developers few, as in this case.  but if you expect to turn it over
    to someone for maintenance, or if you expected to develop with a
    group of people, you'd want to make sure the variable names were a
    little more verbose, probably.

  - You've got the start of a beautiful man page.  You might make it a
    full man page by modifying the mcell man page I've attached.


Add following to meshmorph.
  << "  Running on azzuri at Wed Sep 24 12:11:51 2008\n\n"

Store octree max instead of width in controls.

protect from buffer overruns

record octree statistics to file, e.g. histogram of cell sizes,
histogram of faces per box, or min,max,median instead

fix doxygen documentation for octree files

-----------
separation springs (moved and region)
stretch springs (adjacent to moved)
angle springs (all edges of adjacent faces to moved)

// NOTE the niceness of barycenters should be calculated.
// For now, I assume no nonnice vertices or barycenters.
// container.cc :1310

consider making checkClosestFace period a global constant

replace simple if-else with ternary conditional '?'

3) use a single map to hold all constants (int, double, string)
   map is string->instance of TypedValue
   Note the singleton class will have two fields
     1) string
     2) union , which makes efficient use of memory to access same memory, interpreted in different ways
   use enum to code different data types

Consider not updating vertex and face normal,
and position in tree after every move. Instead
set face to 'dirty' and recompute only if needed.
In State::assignNewVertexCoords
    updateAdjacentFacesInTree(v);
    updateAdjFaceBoundingBoxes(v);
  v->updateAdjacentFaceNormals();
Ideas for marking as dirty
1) in face set normal vector to 0,0,0
2) in vector set normal vector to 0,0,0
3) best of all, use bool in face and vertex classes

Consider switching from map (virtual displacement -> vertex)
to array of bins with linked lists of vd-vertex pairs hanging off.
Use next and previous are pointers to pointer
To remove item in list,
*p=n;
if (n) n->p=p;

Seems that less than one vertex on average changes its closest face per vertex move.
What is the identity of this vertex?

use flag instead of hashset or set or vector with sort and unique

Perform code coverage analysis:
  Include -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage in compile flags
  Run gcov on output.

In Refractory::determineTryAgainOrMoveOn , decreasing move size is NOT always the
  best idea for each of the refraction violations. Sometimes taking a bigger step
  would be better. Delineate these rules.

In State::recordVertAdjFaceEdgeAngles // NOTE THIS ALGORITHM LIKELY TO CHECK EDGES TWICE.

Consider using for_each STL pg 161 meyers book.

Ideas from Jed for improving speed of meshmorph (Oct2007)
----------------------------------------------
1. use closest vertex as closest point
	(closest vertex and closest point will converge as edge length -> 0)
2. fully morph small regions

Improving speed of classifying niceness of vertices
--------------------------------------------------
After picking ray for tracing
1. project faces onto plane orthogonal to ray
2. Use dot product rule to determine edge hit
	i.e. if dot product of vector from face vertex to ray
	and vector from vertex to other vertex is zero,
	then ray hit edge
3. Detect planes coplanar with ray
4. if edge collision, then jog ray, tracing during jog

Pre-sorting mesh object vertices and faces before running meshmoprh
The goal is to improve speed of creating edges, neighborhoods, findsing closest point, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Want path along edges that
1. touches every vertex exactly once
2. maximizes sequential pair-wise overlap
	so as to minimize cache misses to ultimately minimize run time.

simple idea 1 : sort by x then y then z

**************************************************************************
1. improve speed
2. note that simulated annealing was not attempted because it would be too slow
3. mesh surfaces near world bound are still being tweaked during morphing
	especially for large exposed surfaces such as d000
4. Assess validity of assumptions in README for input mesh files.
	Alternatively, leave it to user to check assumptions using meshalyzer.
5. small processes are shrunk to infinitely thin fingers for large
	ECS widths. Need to enforce a minimum process diameter.

THOUGHTS
---------

Typical shape of neuropil is cylinder.
Shrinking diameter of meshed cylinder without changing its length
requires a change in aspect rati of faces.
This potentially has implications for forces on faces as
function of aspect ratio.
