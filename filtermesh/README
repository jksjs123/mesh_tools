The source code is written in C++; it is contained in ./src
Since it makes advance use of templates, it requires a C++ compiler version
3.0 or better (in Stroustrup's classification).
The code compiled successfully under both:
 - DEC's cxx compiler (on both mips/Ultrix and alpha/Ultrix)
    what `which cxx`:   cxxdrv.c 1.12 DEC C++ Compiler 2/9/93
 - GNU g++ versions 2.4.5 and 2.5.8 (on both mips/Ultrix and sgi/Irix)

Note: the code does not successfully compile on many current AT&T based
compilers, such as SGI's C++ compiler because of inlining restrictions.


To compile:

1) Edit the src/C/h++ file to set options for your C++ compiler
   if it is not g++.

2) Then, run make.

The siggraph '92 module is called 'Recon'.
The siggraph '93 module is called 'Meshfit'.
The siggraph '94 module is called 'Subdivfit'.

Two other programs, 'Filtermesh' and 'Filtera3d' let you manipulate meshes
and streams of geometric primitives, respectively.

The program 'Polyfit' is a specialization of mesh optimization (Meshfit) to
curve fitting in 2D.

See the directory ./examples for some test data and expected results.
Refer to the files Reconstruct and Simplify for a brief description of
parameters, and some sample uses.
