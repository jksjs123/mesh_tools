not printing all adjacent faces of nonmanifold edge.
For example just prints two adjacent faces but omits two others
when edge has four adjacent faces.

1. meshalyzer segfaults if face vertex index is larger than max vertex index
2. 'meshalyzer -a -p directory' runs forever
3. 'meshalyzer -a file' behaves oddly
4. meshalyzer fails on some meshes in 'examples' directory

1. Consider using half-edge data structure
	see http://www.openmesh.org/
2. The Euler-Poincare formula for computing genus only assumes that the mesh be orientable. Currently, the mesh is required to be oriented.
3. For multiple-component objects, compute and report of each component.
4. Many of the functions used in meshalyzer were borrowed from meshmorph.
	Yet, the bug fixes from meshmorph have not been applied to meshalyzer.
	Update meshalzyer to latest version of meshmorph.

1. false negative on isOutward test for some meshes
2. Check accuracy of boundaries and clarify the output.
3. Compute genus of each component
4. If DIRECTORY, output genus info as stats with hitogram
5. accept from STDIN and write to STDOUT
6. Add option for binary output for single file or directory
	return 0 or 1 to signal goodness of data
	alternatively, use mesh is good or mesh is not good
7. Add option to analyze directory as independent mesh files.
8. Replace use of char with string to avoid specifying a filename size.
	use std::string not char* OR check strlen before strcpy
9. Run out of memory before all objects are loaded for '-i' option. Slow and memory hog.
10. add 'const' everywhere applicable
11. Add threshold for everything, e.g. face area
13. print to stdout 'Creating __ subvolumes (__,__,__ per axis)
