## IDENTIFIED PROBLEM
# determining if edge exist between a pair of vertices

## IDENTIFIED PROBLEM
# N-squared algorithm (for each edge, for each edge) in computeDistances
# current method:
#   calculate distance between all possible pairs of vertices
# new method:
#   for each vertex
#     find closest vertex by calculating distance
#     for vertices in projection neighborhood
#
#   projection algorithm:
#     projecte all vertices onto random vector
#     for each vertex with a projected distance from target within a window
#       measure 3D separation distance from target to vertex
#       if 3D separation distance is less than halw window width
#       then vertex is closer to target than any vertex
#       lying outside window, hence vertex is candidate for closest.
